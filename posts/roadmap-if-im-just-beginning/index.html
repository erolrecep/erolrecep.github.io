<p><strong>20-Minute Talk Script: My Journey to HPC and Advice for Students</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone, thank you for having me here today. I’m excited to share my journey into High-Performance Computing (HPC), my current role, and some advice on skills development and landing that first job in HPC Admin and/or machine learning engineer. My path has been shaped by a passion for computing, education, and research, and I hope my experiences can offer some insights for your own career journey.</p>
<hr>
<p>My interest in computing started in 2009 with learning how to use Linux based operating systems and system administration of these operating systems. Over time, I shifted my focus to network programming especially programming chat applications and even moving forward having computers talk to each other. The next step was building better algorithm design. I also did have a chance to attend coding competitions to show my programming, problem solving, and algorithmic design for scientific problems. One of my key achievements was participating in a coding competition by optimizing sorting algorithms and leveraging different compilers to improve performance. I got a ranking in this competition. This was an early exposure to HPC principles for me.</p>
<p>During my time in college, I was not limited with the courses given. I always looked for other resources to learn, practice, gain insights, and make them part of my toolset. Data science was one of them that sparked my interest. I wanted to get into this field because with the available compute resources and a laptop, you could easily learn this field and even apply to the problem. Python ecosystem libraries became very popular at that time like today, and it was also the time that these tools like iPython Notebook, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib just started emerging,</p>
<p>In my college, it was mandatory to have at least two internships. I wanted to do an internship in the field of data science. But it wasn&rsquo;t available at corporate at that time. That&rsquo;s why I found internships in big data technologies with SAP-ABAP. It&rsquo;s a German-made big data storage and processing software that has been used by thousands of corporates.</p>
<p>In 2012-2013, mobile app development was trending, so I wanted to learn this technology and built an iOS app. One of my professors offered me a position in a project called &ldquo;e-museum,&rdquo; that would provide historical insights to users visiting cultural sites. Although developing a software and seeing many people used this app daily were encouraging, I found out my real passion was in academia. I enjoyed teaching, mentoring, and research, leading me to pursue a master’s degree and a research assistant position in 2013.</p>
<p>Then, I applied for a study abroad scholarship which was awarded to only ~140 recipients out of more than 1,000 applicants. This opportunity changed my life and I moved to the United States in April 2014 to get my Master&rsquo;s and PhD degrees. I finally completed my PhD in May 2024 and accepted the position at Arkansas High Performance Computing Center.</p>

<p>HPC Admin and AI facilitator brings multiple disciplines together to use them in the job to accomplish your tasks. As an AI facilitator, it&rsquo;s imperative that I must keep myself up to date with the state of the art AI and its derivative domains including computer vision, audio and speech processing, natural language processing, and their capabilities to solve scientific problems in different disciplines. I was already proficient in C and Python but after I started this position, I learned that I need to be proficient in other programming languages as well including Julia, R, Chapel, and other that are being used in different softwares. As part of my daily duties, I provide technical assistance to the researchers in various domains. Sometimes, they tackle with different issues which I wasn&rsquo;t familiar with at first. But I quickly learned, became expert and provided solutions. It may seem very difficult. However, after some time, it becomes fantastic that you feel accomplished of solving problems for others.</p>
<p>HPC domain is changing every day like AI, and you need to keep users up to date with these changes. With this motivation, I built technical training and technical documentation and organized workshops for our users. To be able to provide the same technical training to all users, I organize workshops in multiple university campuses across the state. Therefore, HPC can help these users to accelarate their computation and learn the important steps to use in their later professional life.</p>
<p>Some HPC users require technical support that involves me being part of their research. This is fascinating because I learn different domains. In addition to that, I am solving problems in these domains. Fast learning, adapting to a new domain as well as using new special tools to solve problems become a new norm in this position.</p>
<p>Overall, this role is both technically challenging and fulfilling, allowing me to bridge the gap between researchers and high-performance computational resources.</p>
<hr>
<p>It may seem that learning a lot of things at once can be overwhelming and tiresome. The life has taught me that there is an easier way to accomplish this. Here are the some points:</p>
<ol>
<li>If you think that the content you need to learn is not small enough, then split the content into smaller parts.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need to learn everything at the same time. Schedule your time with the topics to learn. Also, give yourself smaller times to repeat them. Overall, after some time practising, you are going to see that smaller time repeats will give you a way to accomplish large tasks.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to start any task. This is the biggest excuse for postponing.</li>
<li>Build something tangible with every new skill you acquire. This will help solidify your knowledge and give you a portfolio to showcase.</li>
<li>Developing a habit of exploring new tools will help you identify your strengths and find your niche.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>4. Landing the First Job in HPC</strong><br>
The job market is volatile, making it challenging to secure positions in AI, ML, HPC, and software engineering. Many companies are still figuring out whether to invest in traditional approaches or cutting-edge AI technologies. Given this uncertainty, here are my recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build a strong portfolio</strong> – Companies value practical experience. Contribute to open-source projects, develop personal projects, and showcase your work.</li>
<li><strong>Stay adaptable</strong> – Technology is evolving rapidly. Being open to continuous learning will keep you competitive.</li>
<li><strong>Network actively</strong> – Engage with professionals in your field, attend conferences, and seek mentorship to increase your visibility and opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong><br>
My journey into HPC has been shaped by a deep curiosity and a passion for teaching and research. Whether you’re starting out or transitioning careers, focus on strong fundamentals, hands-on projects, and continuous learning. Stay adaptable, and embrace challenges as opportunities to grow. Thank you, and I’m happy to answer any questions over email or LinkedIn!</p>
