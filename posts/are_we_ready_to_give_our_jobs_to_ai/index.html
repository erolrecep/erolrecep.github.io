    <p>Lack of education prompt engineering or how to write the prompts correctly?
System design?
Most of the software engineers don&rsquo;t know bumper to bumper of a software development
Knowing resource consumptionand optimizing the process
Writing the correct documentation Technical communication
Transition from teoretical knowledge to practical knowledge gap
Even today FAANG companies asking Data Structures and Algorithms They&rsquo;re not even asking system design technical documentation knowledge on their interviews
This shows that even you don&rsquo;t judge this knowledge on your new hiring which means you relay on your experienced engineers at the company. Same for the AI!
Companies forced by their investors to use the latest technology and hire cheap engineers
Unnecessary bubble of technology and advertisement &ndash;&gt; Even OpenAI struggle with where to and how to use the technology they have and make profit out of it
openAI just provide chat tool but there is no any initiative to solve complex problems.
_ They just release some benchmarks to attract their model
_ Think about siri. How many people use it today and with which purpose people use this technology. How many times things changed with siri and how many different features were added and removed.
Some of the technologies requires learning curve and education for the users to use in their daily software consumption.
Tesla car on the road. How many drivers prefer to use this driverless option instead of using themselves?
Interesting finding is that in the universities where the technology is changed first then adopted by the companies,
_ Many professors even didn&rsquo;t try the tools of openai chat or notebooklm or other alternatives!</p>
<p>I believe many companies are doing many things wrong.
Think of blockchain technologies. There was a hype but I don&rsquo;t see any big company use this technology is being taught at school
Many of the things were not tested well and this was given to everybody directly.
Many technologies are policyless!</p>
<p>This article is about my views on ai tools and software engineering jobs are being replaced by ai tools or build teams with hybrid approach.
_ There are number of instances that shows that Google, X, Salesforce etc prefer to switch to coding assistant plus experienced human combined software development teams.
_ Who is going to hire the inexperienced developers/software engineers/ml engineers/data scientist?
_ The quality of the coding assistance change based on the knowledge of prompt engineering, engineer&rsquo;s technical knowledge, the flow of software development and so on. In other words, what I mean is that these coding assitant tools would be helpful for the experienced engineers. Because they know the big picture and bumper to bumper of the software development.
For the last thing is that universities should adopt with this change and train the students accordingly. For this purpose, fundings are needed, professors and instructors should be trained well or should train themselves.</p>
